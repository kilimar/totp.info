# [totp.info](https://totp.info)

Simple in-browser [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm) client.

I made this because I needed a better way for a support vendor to be able to verify my users than CallerID or nothing.

The vendor couldn't provide each of their support staff with an actual TOTP client, so having them save a [totp.info](https://totp.info) URL in their password manager for us was a sufficient improvement.
